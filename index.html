        <h2>Team Organization</h2>
        <p>
          Produck allows you to simply organize multiple teams and projects you
          are working on. For startups, we recommend to: Create a folder for
          each department (Product, Success, Marketing, etc) and give manager
          roles to each of your team leads or VPs.

      <div class="organize">
        <h2>Organize your Product Team</h2>
        <p>
          On your Product folder, you can have a sub-folder for Design and a
          sub-folder for Development, allowing both teams to collaborate but
          also to have autonomy on their organization.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src="./assets/QATesting.png" alt="" id="qatesting" />

            Create a project for each one of your core platforms or products,
            and use epics for each separate feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="./assets/text.png" alt="" id="text" />

            Inside each epic, you can create specs for the feature (using the
            inline-rich text editor) and have requirements be contextual to the
            tasks (so no one misses it!)
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="./assets/team.png" alt="" id="team" />

            Use multiple-assignees to assign an epic to everyone involved, so
            they can review and comment on the specs and distribute the work to
            be done.

      <h2>Release with confident, together</h2>
      <p>
        Use Sprints to create releases, combining tasks from multiple projects

        same page.

        <strong>Pro Tip: Increase your revenue!</strong> <br />
        If you invite your clients as collaborators, they will also be able to
        create tasks. This is great because it helps them to brain-dump their
        needs faster, giving you more billable work in your pipeline.

          Have a clear view of how scope changes, intrusions or changes on

          We understand that different teams have different ways of working,
          thatâ€™s why Produck allows teams to collaborate, reducing follow ups
          and keeping everyone in the loop.

        <ul>

            <img src="./assets/graphQl.png" alt="graphQl" id="graphQl" />

            As tasks on Produck can have multiple projects associated to, your
            Product team can review those tasks and add them to the relevant
            products and platforms to be worked by design and engineering.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="./assets/target.png" alt="target" id="target" />

            Have a separate folder for your Success team, with their own project
            to collect feedback, bugs and requests from customers.

          <li>
            <img src="./assets/priority.png" alt="priority" id="priority" />

            As the tasks stays also on the Success team project, they can see
            the status and get notified when there are updates, questions or
            blockers without having to ping your product team constantly.
